The source code for SGrave 2. This repository has **nothing to do** with SGrave 1.



> [!WARNING]
> SGrave 2 is heavily in beta. Expect bugs!
> 
> **SGrave 2 only works on Minecraft 1.21.5 - 1.21.8.**

If you want to download SGrave 2 and try it out, go to https://github.com/Sul4urx/SGrave/releases and go to **SGrave v2a0-beta-1** > **Assets** and download **SGrave.v2a0-beta-1.zip**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you turn on the **KeepInventory** game rule and turn off **doImmediateRespawn** game rule. SGrave 2 can't do this automatically yet.

If you found a bug, report it in **Issues** tab > **New issue**. You can also suggest a new feature there.

If you have a question about this data pack, use `/trigger sgrave2.help` in game.

> [!NOTE]
> You don't need any resource packs to use SGrave 2, unlike SGrave 1.
